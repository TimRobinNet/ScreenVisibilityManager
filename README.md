# ScreenVisibilityManager
The screen visibility manager will mainly help you to disable rendering of UI that is currently hidden behind something opaque. This manager won't do any partial hiding of elements, e.g. hiding part of a popup which is currently hidden by something else - it's really just a small helper to disable rendering of UI that's overlapped by something opaque.
